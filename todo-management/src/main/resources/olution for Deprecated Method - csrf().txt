In the next lecture, we will configure Spring security to understand the HTTP Basic Authentication.

Well, in the recent Spring boot 3.1.0 and Spring security 6.1.0 release, the csrf() method has deprecated and exposed a new version of csrf() method that takes lambda expression implementation.

Deprecated csrf() method:

    http.csrf().disable()

New version of csrf() method:

    http.csrf((csrf) -> csrf.disable())

In the next lecture, please use the below new csrf() method that takes lambda expression implementation to disable the CSRF feature:

    http.csrf((csrf) -> csrf.disable())
